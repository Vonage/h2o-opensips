	tm: Fix transaction leakage with global onreply_route
	Given that the opensips.cfg execution order for replies is:
	    1) onreply_route (global)
	    2) reply_received(), i.e. "tm" module scope
	      2.1) onreply_route (branch)
	      2.2) onreply_route (transaction)

	... this patch fixes some transaction leaks where if the script developer
	matches the current transaction within global onreply_route, e.g. with a
	random statement such as xlog("$T_reply_code\n"), it would cause an
	extra ref after a transaction matching operation would be performed yet
	again (??) within reply_received(), as the "tm" scope begins executing.

	The fix is to simply avoid transaction lookups when evaluating tm
	variables within the non-transactional, global SIP reply route.

	Credits to Bogdan-Andrei Iancu for suggesting this solution

	mid_registrar_save(): Fix shm memleak with no t_relay()
	Since mid_registrar_save() is stateful by definition, it needs the SIP
	transaction to properly function, so always forcing its creation if the
	REGISTER is about to be forwarded is not that significant of a change,
	if any at all.

	Thus, this patch fixes a SHM memleak on the following type of logic:

	    mid_registrar_save();

	    # script terminates without having created the transaction,
	    # so mid_registrar's "prepped" data does not get freed on T deletion
	    exit;

	* [fced368a2] :

	SIP digest auth: Improve handling for multiple digest challenges
	Before this patch, OpenSIPS would always work with the digest
	credentials of the 1st WWW/Proxy-Authenticate header field.

	While RFC 3261 does not define the behavior with multiple
	WWW/Proxy-Authenticate headers, in § 22.3 it is stated that:

	   Note that if an authentication scheme that does not support realms is
	   used in the Proxy-Authorization header field, a proxy server MUST
	   attempt to parse all Proxy-Authorization header field values to
	   determine whether one of them has what the proxy server considers to
	   be valid credentials.

	... so a proxy must _walk_ through unacceptable headers until it finds
	one with "valid" credentials.  In the context of the upcoming RFC 8760,
	this would also mean: finding an auth header field with an MD5 digest
	algorithm, which is the only one currently supported.

	TL;DR: this patch improves the "uac", "uac_registrant" and
	"b2b_entities" modules so they correctly process 3 WWW-Authenticate
	headers with the following algorithm preference:
	    algorithm=SHA-512-256
	    algorithm=SHA-256
	    algorithm=MD5

	... and correctly build an MD5-based response for the 3rd header field.

	Code quality: Use str_match() instead of !str_strcmp()
	Reasons behind this change:
	    - better performance: str_strcmp() includes lots of redundant checks
	      and performs worse than the simplistic str_match()

	    - safer code: although by making this change we increase the chance
	      of a segfault (if either "a" or "b" strings are NULL), the crash
	      will immediately indicate the coding bug and will be easy to
	      troubleshoot.  By the same argument, nobody complains that
	      memset() or strcmp() include zero NULL checks: they don't have to!

	    - more meaningful code: logically speaking, in most cases, the
	      programmer simply intends to _match_ two strings, rather than to
	      order them lexicographically...

	    lb_start(): A, B

	* [b261b675b] :

	Fix next_hop crash (seen in nathelper nh_timer) due to reading reused mem
	Problem:

	- get_domain_db_ucontacts (through get_domain_ucontacts) was handing out
	  (next_hop) pointers to memory that was unused. This resulted in a
	  crash when this memory was reused before the invalid pointer was
	  reused.

	Relevant issues and commits:

	- #1652 [OpenSIPS crashes since of child that serves rtpproxy]
	- e162f5f10 [fix 1652: usrloc: make next_hop point within the shared buffer]
	- #1710 [nathelper next_hop off by one for usrloc path]
	- 0300eb1d5 [fix 1710 / revert 1652: usrloc: fix next hop compute for ...]

	That is: e162f5f10 fixes this exact problem in get_domain_db_ucontacts, in
	get_domain_mem_ucontacts and in get_domain_cdb_ucontacts (cdb_pack_ping_data).

	But in 0300eb1d5 it is reverted for only get_domain_db_ucontacts.

	This fix:

	- Rewrites the fix for get_domain_db_ucontacts and
	  get_domain_cdb_ucontacts, making it less fragile/bug-prone.
	- Adds comments about fragility to get_domain_mem_ucontacts
	- Fixed unaligned memcpy that might affect non-intel CPUs:
	  `((struct proxy_l *)cp)->name.s = next_hop_host`

	Bug reported and fix tested by Jasper Hafkenscheid @hafkensite (VoIPGRID).

	fraud_detection: Add the possibility to disable stats
	A (0) value for any of the fraud detection thresholds now means: "ignore
	this threshold", instead of: "raise an event on each call for this
	threshold?!".  Although (0) values could, in theory, have been useful
	for event generation testing purposes before this patch, this is a small
	price to pay in order to gain the ability to disable a stat.  Developers
	can now add 1 more CPS and still keep testing with a new (1) value :)

	Although the DB schema changes slightly, due to the added "DEFAULT 0",
	it is fully backwards-compatible with the previous one, except
	fraud_detection row INSERTs will now be more quiet, generating no more
	warnings from the backend (e.g. "Column does not have a default
	value..." -> but still defaults to 0, thanks to non-strict mode, leading
	to strange warnings from the module).

	Fixes #890

	Fixed uac_auth() on sequential requests in dialogs were uac_auth() was already used
	The fix solves the conflict between the changes over the cseq value coming from (1) dialog module, trying to increment the cseq to compensate the cseq change during INVITE auth and (2) the uac module incrementing the cseq again because of auth'ing a sequential request.

	The solution was to first indetify such case in uac_auth() and to use a larger delete lump (when replacing the cseq) in uac_auth(). Such a larger/wider delete lump will invalidate the lump added by the dialog module.

	This is a follow up on #1969

	* [e3ca95ecd] :

	rr: Fix ordering issues with add_rr_param() and create_dialog()
	Commits bd1719dcf and c263182ee4d introduced regressions for
	record_route() and record_route_preset(), respectively, which caused
	add_rr_param() to not work anymore in the following sequence of function
	calls:

	create_dialog() with a "dlg_match_mode" != DID_NONE
	record_route() or record_route_preset()
	add_rr_param() # would not do anything, simply acting as a NOP

	The reason is that the "fake" lump chain which was meant to hold
	all add_rr_param() operations prior to an eventual record_route() call
	would no longer be masked after the record_route() and would continue to
	accumulate data from subsequent add_rr_param() calls.  Since it was
	meant to be a "fake" chain from the beginning (maybe the user doesn't
	call record_route() at all!), the data would simply be lost.

	Many thanks to John Quick for the accurate report and instructions on
	how to reproduce the issue!

	Fix wrong type of lumps.
	As the eoh (Enf Of Header) is determined during the on-demand parsing, the add_lump() may wrongly lable a lump as "header" or "body" (as the add_lump() may be used before the parsing reached the EOH).
	So, better identify all headers asap, so the add_lump() will properly work all the time. This will not add any overhead, as in 99.9999% of the case, due the functions used in cfg, anyhow you end up parsing the whole message.

	cachedb_mongodb: fix crashes when loading module along with tls_mgm
	Loading the cachedb_mongodb module causes the openssl library to be
	initialized in the pre-daemon process, by the mongoc library's
	constuctor, before tls_mgm gets the chance to do its own initialization
	in the attendant process.
	This commit overwrites the openssl functions used by the mongoc library
	in order to actually skip the initialization and leave it to tls_mgm.

	HP_MALLOC: Aggregate SHM statistic updates
	It is better to update the stats with a diff of the

	bogus values. (i.e. negative "used" and/or "real_used")

	HP_MALLOC: Add "re-scanning" logic
	Given that HP_MALLOC has fine-grained locking, if the big fragment
	shifts down from hash bucket N to bucket N-1 due to another
	process performing the allocation, we may actually "lose" it during
	our own scan, since bucket N-1 was empty and we're now waiting
	for bucket N to unlock.  When it does unlock, it will also be empty.

	As a solution: retry the scan up to N times, as long as it's feasible!

2020-04-27  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [3803441bb] :

	HP_MALLOC:  Dramatically reduce memory fragmentation
	For HP_MALLOC to offer optimal parallel allocation performance, it
	needs the memory to be fragmented: the more available chunks, the better
	its performance.  However, there needs to be some coalescing as well,
	otherwise variable-length allocations past the 10K range will
	quickly deplete (fragment) even SHM pools of 10+ GB.

	This patch adds the following heuristics to HP_MALLOC and HP_MALLOC_DBG:

	    * shm_malloc(): only split a fragment if the resulting chunk is at
	      least MIN_SPLIT_SIZE bytes (default 256 for PKG, 4096 for SHM)
	    * shm_free(): try to coalesce the next fragment (enough to fix all
	      fragmentation issues)

	rest_client: Disable "Expect: 100-continue" by default
	Although the "100 Continue" flow sometimes saves bandwidth when the
	server replies with an error response, it also has some drawbacks:

	    * extra roundtrips, adding latency and complicating the async
	        handling
	    * the client body upload and server body download must be performed
	        within the same curl_multi_perform() loop, during the async
	        resume callback, limiting the amount of parallelism that can be
	        obtained when compared to the simple flow

	From now on, the "100 Continue" flow for POST/PUT requests with bodies
	larger than 1024 bytes is disabled by default.  Developers may enable it
	using a new, backwards-compatible, "enable_expect_100" module parameter.

	If a transaction has no real signalling branch, but only doing t_wait_for_new_branches(), upon caller cancel inject a 487 reply on the phony/waiting branch in order to terminate the transaction on the spot.
	The provious behavior was to wait (even after the cancel) for the phony/waiting branch timeout (fr_inv_timeout) and to generate an 408 timeout.
	Now, there is no useless waiting and a proper 487 is generated.

	* [f86167dbe] :

	b2b_entities: don't try to insert in db nonprintable param
	The b2b_entities module expects that the parameter provided during
	entity registrations to be a string. It stores this string in the
	database. However, there are cases where modules (such as siprec) force
	their parameter to be a pointer to a structure, therefore the string
	becomes non-printable. This breaks certain entities insertion in the
	database.
	This commit prevents the module from inserting a key that's not
	printable. In the case of siprec this is not a problem, since the module
	does not rely on the value that's stored in the parameter for restart -
	it rebuilds the value anyway.

	This is a temorary fix - ideally, the parameter should be able to be
	serialized before written in the database; although this is not possible
	now, it will be possible starting with 3.1. Hence this temporary fix.

	* [59417a935] :

	event_flatstore: improve handling of multiple subscriptions for the same file
	Use the same internal shm struct corresponding to a file for each evi
	subscription for that file. This fixes an issue with the 'evi_flat_rotate' MI
	command not properly "rotating" multiple subscriptions to the new file. Besides,
	a file is now opened only once regardless of how many subscribtions there are
	for the same file.
	Also, do not reuse an old 'evi_reply_sock' structure for a new subscription for
	the same file (if the file corresponding to an old subscription was not yet
	closed by all processes). This led to incorrect expire times for new
	subscriptions.

	3. The timerec should be allocated in pkg memory, there's no reason why

	When the dialog module was sending re-INVITEs, the ACK to those
	re-INVITEs was generated by the TM, thus was lacking a valid Route set.
	This commit prevents the TM from generating the ACK, having the dialog
	module sending it, with the learned Route set.

	tm: dup in pkg the faked msg headers
	before this commit, the faked reqests were having the headers fields
	stored in shm_mem and shared with the tm request uas. Thus, during
	concurrent accesses to one of the headers' `parsed` field, the first
	process would have parsed the field in pkg memory, and the second
	process would have found that header already parsed. However, it
	couldn't read the other's process memory, resulting in an invalid
	access.
	Moving the headers in a private area for the faked request solves this
	issue, as each process will have its own `parsed` field in pkg memory.

	Credits go to Rizwan Syed and Jonathan Hulme from Connex CS for
	reporting and supporting the testing and fixing of this issue.

	This issue has also been reported in ticket #1808

	We need to be sure that dialog module is init before acc (if dialog is loaded), to prevent any crashes when acc registers the DLGCB_LOADED callback in dialog (the registraion of the callback will try to run the callback on any pre-existing dialogs, so the hash table for the dialogs must be created/init).
	It is a loose dependency as it does not require the dialog module to be loaded. But if loaded, it must be init before ACC module.

	While adding support for Content-Disposition: no-cancel (see 4747da559f4df161441be8373488dee9fd16c282), a regression was made, allowing TM to send out cancel (upon internal 408 timeout) to branches with no incoming replies.
	Only this cancelling scenaio was affected (internal 408 timeout). The cancelling upon 200OK or incoming cancel were not affected.

	Thanks to Richard Revels for spotting and reporting this.

	Function cdb_add_ct_update ignores matching modes set on opensips.cfg, this result in an unexpected behaviour if the user sets matching_mode=0 since multiple records with same contact (but different callid) are stored in the cache database.
	This fix checks, before getting the base64 hash, if matching mode is contact only, if yes, the callid string is not included in the resulted base64 hash.
	If matching mode is CONTACT_CALLID, this function behaves like before, and the hash is calcuated using contact:callid.

	dialog: run loaded callback for dialogs loaded from db
	Fixes a bug introduced in commit 8c8f27f that was relying on the fact
	that dialogs were loaded from db *before* registering the loaded
	callback, due to the dependencies mechanism. Thus the loaded callback
	was ran on the spot, when the it was registered.

	However, this is not entirely correct, since there are modules (such as
	acc module) that do not have dialog dependencies, but still register
	LOADED dialogs - in these cases, if dialog was loaded (in script) after
	the module itself, the callback was never run. This behavior was
	amplified by commit 3ddae43, which was basically never loading the
	dialogs before registering the callback, thus the loaded callbacks were
	never ran.

	The purpose of this commit is to fix this issue, reported in #1754

	rest_client:  Let libcurl use the system malloc functions
	The fact that libcurl spawns a thread in order to perform each transfer
	is well known.  Also known was the fact that by instructing libcurl to
	use the pkg_*alloc() functions, an OpenSIPS worker must synchronize with
	the libcurl thread before they can both manipulate the PKG pool.  Commit
	900f6c996c697b was an attempt to solve this, however the fix DOES NOT
	hold, as it was implemented in that commit (the curl thread is aware of
	the thread lock while the original process ignores it...).

	The only way we can make libcurl use the opensips pkg mem allocation
	functions is by changing pkg_malloc() itself to also grab a thread
	lock.  And this is already too much, as it would unnecessarily slow down
	the pkg allocator, while the benefits are minimal anyway: what do we
	stand to gain if libcurl uses our mem pool?  Close to nothing.

	We just let libcurl use the system memory manager (along with as much
	memory as it wants) and we're done with this issue for good.

	This will easily lead to memory corruption and crashes. As real case, different replies to the same request may trigger print_rr_body in topology_hiding(), over the same shm cloned request.

	* [033db9fd0] :

	Fixed uninit len for th_contact_encode_passwd param.
	As the used len was all the time 10 (the len of the default passwd), if you have set a shorter one, the actual used passwd has some trailing memory garbage (up to 10 char len). This grabage could be (99.999%) constant during runtime, but 100% different after a restart. Shorly, the decoding on ongoing contact would have failed after a restart.

	acc: Do not dereference NULL dialog contexts
	This bug could be triggered in failover scenarios, where the accounting
	context would be created and cleaned up at least once before actually
	calling do_accounting().  One way to trigger it would be:

	    * create_dialog();
	    * $acc_extra(foo) = "bar"; # create a dialog-stored acc context
	    * t_relay(); exit; # msg is relayed, but ctx is unused =>
		the code frees it and leaves a NULL dialog value marker.
	    * inside failure_route, do: $acc_extra(foo) = "bar".  We fetch the
	      NULL context stored inside dialog, dereference it and crash.

	Many thanks to 46Labs for reporting this issue, as well as providing
	extensive troubleshooting information.

	The node that has a backup state for the sharing tag of a dialog
	was incorrectly:
	* skipping the replication of all dialog events
	* bypassing all registered DLGCB_TERMINATED and DLGCB_EXPIRED callbacks

	This behavior was causing issues when replies and sequential requests did
	arrive on the backup node. Eg. unable to match and fix the BYE for an
	existing topology hiding dialog.

	After this fix, only the acc and cgrates modules will skip all actions in the
	above mentioned callbacks if the sharing tag is backup.

	rest_client: Fix some POST/PUT corner-cases
	This patch addresses two rare bugs such that they may now only occur
	with old curl versions (pre 7.17.1, that's pre 2007).

	When calling rest_post() or rest_put(), assuming we're fetching the
	request body buffer into "req_body" via fixup_get_svalue():

	    1. since req_body->s is not dup'ed and may point to a PV buf,
		the next SIP message may impact the currently "just launched"
		async transfer by overriding the value stored in the PV buffer
		before libcurl fully reads it

	    2. req_body->s is provided by a PV which does not NULL-terminate
		strings (e.g. $du), thus curl's strlen() may overflow or crash

	dialog: fix unset_dlg_profile() linkers deletion
	This commit fixes the following bugs introduced in commit 00cddf7:
	1. when it was called, it was removing all the linkers of a dialog
	2. it was not removing the actual linker it was called for, causing
	constant increase in size for that specific profile (and leak)
	3. when temporary copying the profiles list, the values were not copied,
	thus they might have dissapeared when the actual cleanup was done.

	Many thanks to Jonathan Hulme for reporting the issue and providing
	testing framework for detecting the bug and testing the fix!

	systemd: Properly shut down OpenSIPS 2.4+ instances
	OpenSIPS 2.4 is meant to be shut down gracefully, in order to minimize
	any form of data corruption caused by partial processing of SIP
	messages.  Running "killall opensips" has a good chance of deadlocking
	OpenSIPS for the next 45 seconds, especially if it's doing a lot of
	logging.  This is often the case with the current systemd logic.

	This patch updates the opensips systemd service files so they only
	deliver SIGTERM to the attendant process.

2018-07-23  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [82b14ed05] :

	core: Greatly reduce chance of truncated corefiles
	Before commit 8073d4de8ed, the SIGTERM signal delivered by the attendant
	process to a process who had already crashed and would be dumping its
	memory inside the SIGSEGV handler would stay queued and not disrupt the
	generation of the corefile.  At worst, corefile generation would take
	above "shutdown_time" seconds (60), and OpenSIPS would SIGKILL its
	entire process group and definitively terminate.

	Now, OpenSIPS behavior has changed to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives _everyone_ a grand total of 5 seconds to finish
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL the entire instance

	This behavior is too restrictive for the average spinning disk
	performance.  Coupled with the fact that SHM pools of 2+ GB are common
	nowadays AND the fact that, occasionally, corefiles come in multiples, 5
	seconds is not a lot of time.

	This patch fixes the behavior to:
	    * attendant broadcasts a graceful IPC shutdown job
	    * attendant gives non-crashed processes 5 seconds to obey
	    * if not ready -> SIGKILL any processes which are still running
	    * perform cleanup(60 sec) (leave the core-dumping processes alone)
	    * exit or abort cleanup (leave the core-dumping processes alone)

	Thanks to Bogdan for significantly directing the design of this patch

	* [0d5864c24] :

	core: Clean up outdated SIGKILL-based shutdown code
	When not in "debug" mode (i.e. when opensips successfully daemonizes),
	the kill_all_children(SIGKILL) function will actually send SIGKILL
	to the entire process group ID, including its owner.  In this case, all
	code that follows after it is _dead_ code.

	This includes the final cleanup() sequence, which would be desirable to
	run even during an emergency shutdown (e.g. OpenSIPS deadlocked,
	SIGKILL'ed all its children, yet managed to do a last-second DB dump of
	all dialogs and contacts).

	This patch fixes the following:

	    * rewrite kill_all_children() to actually do what it says: "only
	      kill the children".  No need to send kill() to the pgid.

	    * remove the alarm()+wait() logic around kill_all_children(SIGKILL).
	      Even if opensips is not daemonized (so the SIGKILL only gets sent
	      to each enumerated process), if, by absurd, we failed to count all
	      processes within the for() loop of the first call, installing a
	      signal handler for yet another kill_all_children(SIGKILL) call is
	      pretty much useless -- we will still stay stuck in while(wait()).

	    * remove the "now unused" sig_alarm_kill() function

	    * improve function docs

	receive multiple responses (read: "To" tags) for each individual branch

2018-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [045eea09b] :

	path: Fix "use_path_received" in double-Path scenarios
	Due to the fact that run_rr_callbacks() returns the 2nd Route (Path)
	header field value when previously having done protocol switching (thus
	having inserted two Path headers), the "use_path_received" feature of
	the path module would not work -- it wouldn't set the $du at all.

	The reason for this is that add_path_received() appends its ";received="
	to inside Path #1 (the outbound path of the registration / the inbound
	path of future requests) when doing double-Path recording.

	This patch simply moves the ";received=" append operation performed by
	add_path_received() into Path #2 (inbound path of registration /
	outbound path of future requests), and adapts other code that needs it
	(e.g. save("location", "p1v")) to properly be able to fetch it.

	Reported by @futsystems

	Fixes #1358

2018-05-24  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [0e60448cb] :

	path: Add escaping logic for add_path_received()
	Simply dumping a SIP URI as a ";received=" Path header field parameter
	value is problematic and leads to two kinds of issues:

	a. invalid SIP URIs, where the ";transport=" is specified twice:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;lr; ...
	       ... received=sip:127.0.0.1:51959;transport=tcp>

	b. in double Path scenarios (e.g. when switching protocols from, say,
	TCP -> UDP), since the ";received=" is inserted as the
	inbound Path header field value, this can lead to a strange
	"protocol conversion" effect:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917;transport=tcp>
	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;transport=tcp;r2=on;lr>

	^ notice how the inbound Path intended to advertise an UDP URI, but the
	add_path_received() managed to "convert" it into a TCP URI because of
	its inability to escape its token. nathelper is an easy first victim of
	this conversion, as it will attempt to send pings using the incorrect
	transport after reading the topmost Path (Route) header.

	This patch adds escaping/unescaping logic for the ";received=" feature
	of add_path_received() along with any code that makes use of this
	feature. Example resulting URI for the above example:

	Path: <sip:127.0.0.1:5061;r2=on;lr ...
	       ... ;received=sip:127.0.0.1:42917%3dtransport%3btcp>

	dialog: Always match dialogs using dlg_match_mode
	This patch changes the default behavior of match_dialog() and
	topology_hiding_match(), where they would both forcibly use DID_FALLBACK
	matching, regardless of the value of the "dlg_match_mode" modparam.

	Starting with 2.4, we change this behavior such that they default
	to simply playing along with "dlg_match_mode", which is a lot
	more intuitive from a script writing perspective.

	If need be, a specific dialog matching behavior may be enforced for
	certain types of traffic using the newly added optional parameters of
	match_dialog() and topology_hiding_match().

	dialog: Fix Re-INVITE pinging issues with parallel forking
	The Re-INVITE pinging code would always leak both SDP and contact buffers
	when parallel forking. Moreover, depending on which branch answered
	the call, in some cases OpenSIPS would only Re-INVITE ping one of the
	parties involved, even if both "Rr" create_dialog() flags are set.

	This patch fixes the above issues by storing the SDPs of each forked
	branch into the "callee" leg array. Each call leg gets created before
	the INVITE branch is sent out, rather than only getting created upon
	matching a 200 OK reply. When matching a reply, the corresponding leg
	becomes 1 + the Via branch idx, which added by tm. (0, 1, 2, ...)

	Remaining issue:
	Proper handling for the multi-200 OK scenario, as we currently still
	overwrite the callee SDP at each 200 OK.

	* [187f7d08e] :

	Fixed empty socket info in DB during reload
	The insert subscription code may push an empty string for the socket info, so the DB reload code must cope with this without error.
	Also relax the reloading sequence - ignore broken subscription records rather than stopping the entire reload and breaking the startup sequence.

	usrloc: Fix possible crash during contact pinging
	This patch fixes a bug introduced in commit 02e6a641292, where the
	output buffer does not contain a leading "0000" marker despite the
	"ul.get_all_contacts()" function returning a 0 ("all contacts have been
	dumped, the buffer is properly formatted").

	Reported by @thesipguy

	Credits to Răzvan Crainea for spotting the bug

	      { pk: <key>, aor: <aor>, home_ip: <home_ip> }. This advertises
	      the AoR's presence in our location to other PoPs.
	    - on AoR lookup: fetch all <home_ip> values of <aor>, add as
	      call branches of the current INVITE, on top of any existing local
	      contact branches
	    - on AoR remove: delete our <key> from NoSQL, as well as the AoR
	      from local storage.

	A sharding clustering is a presence cluster where each node keeps its own set of watchers and presentities of an interest. Any new Published presentity is replicated to all the cluster nodes, but stored only by nodes interested in it (if there are watchers for that presentity). For initial subscriptions, there is quering mechnism inside the cluster - to try to fetch the presentity data from any other node.

	When adding a body part (directly via sipmsgops module or indirectly via sip_i module), you can specify an optional list of SIP headers (fully formated, including the header terminator) to be pushed into the part next to the Content-Type header.
	The specific changes:
	* in sipmsgops module, the add_body_part() takes a third optional parameter for extra headers to be pushed into the part;
	* in sip_i module, the add_isup_part() funtion takes a second optional parameter for defining a custom set of extra headers;
	* in sip_i_module, a new module parameter "default_part_headers" can be used to define the default set of headers to be automatically pushed into the ISUP parts.

	cachedb: Simplify the column-oriented API
	Since some NoSQL backends support upsert-enabled "set" and "unset" operations
	on multiple key/value pairs using a single query, we can merge the "set_cols()"
	and "unset_cols()" functions into a single one: "update()". Current
	backends known to support this are MongoDB and Cassandra.

	Any backends which do not support the above will have to implement the update()
	endpoint using two queries instead of one.

	F_MALLOC: Recover from double pointer free
	This patch makes F_MALLOC more robust in production by avoiding memory
	corruption in case of double free operations. Previously, the hash state
	would immediately get corrupted on such operations, and it would only be
	a matter of time before the allocator would crash in some random place
	with a useless backtrace resembling:

	\#0  0x0000000000507209 in fm_remove_free (qm=0x7f7d578d2010, size=56) at
	mem/f_malloc.c:200

	similar to QM_MALLOC.

2018-02-14  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [2d3c0733d] :

	Add a basic unit testing framework
	Currently, this framework only supports writing unit tests for core
	code, but there are plans to expand it such that module tests can be
	easily written as well.

	The chosen C unit testing framework is libtap
	(https://github.com/zorgnax/libtap) - very lightweight and full of goodies.

	In order to write a core unit test, you should write the test file
	under a "test/" dir which resides right next to the tested file. The
	build system is smart enough to link any such test files placed in
	random test dirs all across the core codebase. Next, you enrol your
	test file to be init'ed and run in test/unit_tests.c, and you're done.

	To run the entire unit testing suite, just do "make test". You will
	have to type this command twice if you haven't enabled "-DUNIT_TESTS"
	under Makefile.conf beforehand.

2018-01-29  Bogdan-Andrei Iancu  <bogdan at opensips dot org>
	* [091149b07] :

	Added new load support based on active/idle time.
	The way the internal load is calculated and reported is radically changed. Instead of providing per-interface load and only for SIP related processing, the new "load" support calculates per process the amount of time spent in any processing (outside the I/O reactor) versus total time. The time granularity is 1us. This new system covers any kind of handling (SIP, timer, async, etc) inside a process.
	The TCP main and timer handler will also provide load information. In the future, the extra processes (per module) may easily record their load information.
	Each process (and globally) reports 3 load statistics:
	* realtime load, computed over the last 1s
	* last 1 minute load
	* last 10 minutes load

	Example via "opensipsctl fifo get_statistics load:" :
	load:load:: 24
	load:load1m:: 19
	load:load10m:: 1
	load:load-proc-1:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load10m-proc-1:: 0
	load:load-proc-2:: 0
	load:load1m-proc-2:: 0

	use of this feature.

	mid_registrar: Improve the advertised socket logic
	Instead of blindly advertising the first UDP interface in the
	self-generated, outgoing Contact URIs, the mid_registrar is now
	aware of the next SIP hop and properly advertises the actual
	sending interface which will be used. This includes any forced
	send socket logic at script level.

	* [86628e6d4] :

	mid_registrar: Fix a PKG memory leak
	Although the TMCB_RESPONSE_IN callback provides a reference to the initial
	request during reply processing, this sip_msg must not be parsed (i.e. passed
	to parse_headers()), otherwise we leak PKG memory, since parsing is
	PKG-based, while the request buffer is copied in SHM.

	The current workaround for mid_registrar is to immediately duplicate all
	contact-related data we could possibly need, should the contact successfully
	register on the downstream registrar. This copying takes place during request
	processing. Once the reply arrives, we only make use of this info in order to
	store the contact in usrloc, and barely even use the "req" sip_msg
	provided by tm.

	freeswitch: Further implement generic event subscribing
	Currently, we can subscribe for generic FS events and they get

	Patch summary:

	    - refactor the api->evs_sub() function to take an ipc_handler_type
	      as parameter.

	* [6b29c9c04] :

	freeswitch: Implement the fs_esl() API command
	This API call allows execution of an arbitrary FreeSWITCH ESL command on
	an arbitrary FS interface. It has the following flow:
	    1. script worker
		- calls freeswitch_esl(), hence api->fs_esl()
		- fires an IPC job to the FS connection manager
		- busy-waits for an SHM response (with sleep())

	    2. FS connection manager
		- receives the IPC job, runs the ESL command
		- places the reponse in SHM for the worker to find

	    3. script worker
		- finds the corresponding response, stores it in the output
		  pvar (if provided) and resumes the OpenSIPS script

	mid_registrar: Fix NAT issues in "contact" insertion mode
	This patch completely reworks the saving/matching logic with regards
	to the SIP contacts generated by the mid-registrar. It is only relevant
	to working modes "0" (mirror) and "1" (contact throttling).

	The former logic (encoding the requests's Contact as a URI parameter
	of the outgoing contact) was somewhat stateless, as it would forward
	requests to the mid-registrar's contacts directly to their actual Contact
	URIs (UA side). When NAT comes into play, this no longer works well.

	Fortunately, the user location already handles this problem. Thus, we
	change the mid-registrar to advertise contact IDs instead of the device's
	contact. As requests arrive for the contact IDs, we are easily able to
	look up their corresponding user location AoR, contact, along with any
	other useful information for NAT traversal.

	This mechanism is required by the mid-registrar, which needs to
	"reserve" contact IDs while the main registrar decides upon them.
	This means that a blank urecord structure must be kept alive during
	this process.

	By reference counting the blank urecord structures, we prevent them
	from being cleared by the timer before the outgoing registrations
	get a chance to receive a reply.

	Relying on the fact that all modules that register dialog callbacks are initialised
	after the dialog module (thanks to module dependencies), we can run all DLGCB_LOADED
	callbacks at registration time and also keep them in a list for calling them later
	(i.e reloading from database via MI cmd or receiving replicated dialog).

	This fixes a series of bugs where the DLGCB_LOADED callback is not run during, e.g.
	"dlg_db_sync" MI command or received replicated dialogs which do not have their
	callbacks installed or run.

	* [99181710c] :

	TCP engine: Fix a race condition related to con lifetime management
	Connections which received a read event concurrently with their
	expiration time could trigger an indefinitely long, CPU wasteful, rapid
	succession of back-forth passing of the connection object between TCP Main
	and a TCP worker process.

	The fix involves adding a TCP connection lifetime update in the TCP worker
	just after receiving the connection object from TCP Main (this is correct
	- there is some pending data, the connection is non-idle), before the
	expiration check is done.

	Thanks to Bogdan for helping with troubleshooting


2017-06-21  Liviu Chircu  <liviu at opensips dot org>
	* [04e2d6e5f] :

	TCP engine: Fix ref counting bug in async writes
	TCP writes done by TCP workers were subject to an extra
	dereferencing operation, potentially leading to memory corruption
	due to SHM overwriting on freed tcp_connection structs.

	This patch eliminates the extra dereferening operation, while also
	taking care not to break the code for non-TCP worker writers, which
	will now have their passed connections dereferenced by TCP main.

	[proto_hep] fix handling tcp requests coming in multiple chunks
		This commit fixes 2 bugs:
		1) fixes not reading second part of a single TCP request
	because of bad parsed pointer update;
		2) fixes major bug that was causing packets to be processed
	infinite times by hep callback when one message + some part of a
	second message came in a chunk and in the second chunk it was the
	second part of the second message; the tcp request structure was
	not updated(complete was not set to 0 after first message was
	processed) causing the second message to be processed an infinte amount
	of times into the database;
